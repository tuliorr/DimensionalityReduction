# Dimensionality Reduction

## Intro
* This project was developed as a form of evaluation of the course "Dimensionality Reduction" in the MBA in Data Science at the University of Fortaleza.

## Objetive
* This project aims to analyze the mathematical descriptors of the senior year in Brazilian schools

## Description
* The Mathematics reference matrix is composed of four themes, related to skills developed by students. Within each theme there is a set of descriptors linked to the skills developed. The set of descriptors is different in each series evaluated.

  * ```THEME I``` - INTERACTING WITH NUMBERS AND FUNCTIONS
  * ```THEME II``` - LIVING WITH GEOMETRY
  * ```THEME III``` - LIVING THE MEASURES
  * ```THEME IV``` - TREATMENT OF INFORMATION

* The descriptors of each theme can be seen in ```ref_descritores.pdf```

* The analysis was divided in two levels: 
  * ```Data exploration```
  * ```Dimensionality reduction methods in relation to the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models```
